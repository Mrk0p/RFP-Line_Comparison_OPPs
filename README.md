#Line Comparison Program
UC-1 :- As a fan of geometry, I want to model a line based on a point consisting of (x, y) co-ordinates
using the Cartesian system, So that I can calculate its length .

UC-2 :- As a fan of geometry, I want to check equality of two lines based on the end points, So
that I know when two lines are the equal. - Using Java equals method

UC-3 :- As a fan of geometry, I want to compare two lines based on the end points, So that I know
one line is equal, greater or less than the other line. - Using Java compareTo method to compare 2 Lengths
